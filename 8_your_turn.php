* If I could offer two major tips:
* 1. Copy/paste -- don't reinvent the wheel! Feel free to liberally borrow from the previous exercises
* 	 and only change what you need to.
* 2. Ask for help -- the devs are here to give you a hand! Struggling is good for learning, but time
*    is limited and we'd love to help you get un-stuck or sketch out an idea.
